The two py scripts are written in Python3, and the encryption principle is based on the XOR encryption theory

To run the encrypted.Py, you can encrypt the contents of the original.Txt, and then encrypt the two files, the random key and the ciphertext

Running "decrypt.Py", you can decrypt the ciphertext through the "random key", decrypt the decrypted file ".Txt""

You must also have two keys, the random key and the ciphertext, to complete the decryption

In theory, the successful decryption of the decrypted file ".Txt" is identical to the content and format of the original.Txt (this version has not yet solved the escape character problem)
